This is the codebook for the coursera getting and cleaning data course project.

## Data

The dataset for this project was created by cleaning and transforming the UCI Human Activity Recognition (HAR) data containing measurements from the accelerometer and gyroscope of a Samsung Galaxy S II Smartphone worn by a test person around the waist performing six different activities. The goal of the experiment, which was conducted by 30 persons, was to distinguish between the movements using the sensor data alone. 

The cleaned and transformed data can be found in the file *tidy_data.txt*. It was created by merging the training and testing data of the original dataset and doing some further transformations and subsetting, which are explained in detail below.   


## Variables







3) a code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that you performed to clean up the data called CodeBook.md.

GitHub contains a code book that modifies and updates the available codebooks with the data to indicate all the variables and summaries calculated, along with units, and any other relevant information.
