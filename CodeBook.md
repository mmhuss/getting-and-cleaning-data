This is the codebook for the coursera getting and cleaning data course project.

## Data

The dataset for this project was created by cleaning and transforming the UCI Human Activity Recognition (HAR) data containing measurements from the accelerometer and gyroscope of a Samsung Galaxy S II Smartphone. The cleaned and transformed data can be found in the file tidy_data.txt. 



## Variables







3) a code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that you performed to clean up the data called CodeBook.md.

GitHub contains a code book that modifies and updates the available codebooks with the data to indicate all the variables and summaries calculated, along with units, and any other relevant information.
